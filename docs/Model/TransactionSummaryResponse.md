Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**creditAmount** | [**\macropage\SDKs\ebay\rest\finance\Model\Amount**](Amount.md) |  | [optional] 
**creditBookingEntry** | **string** | The enumeration value indicates whether the dollar amount in the creditAmount field is a charge (debit) to the seller or a credit.

**creditCount** | **int** | This integer value indicates the total number of the seller&#39;s sales and/or credits that match the input criteria. Note: Unless the transactionType filter is used in the request to retrieve a specific type of monetary transaction (sale, buyer refund, or seller credit), the creditCount and creditAmount fields account for both order sales and seller credits (the count and value is not distinguished between the two monetary transaction types). This field is generally returned, even if 0, but it will not be returned if a transactionType filter is used, and its value is set to either REFUND, DISPUTE, or SHIPPING_LABEL. | [optional]

**onHoldAmount** | [**\macropage\SDKs\ebay\rest\finance\Model\Amount**](Amount.md) |  | [optional] 
**onHoldBookingEntry** | **string** | The enumeration value indicates whether the dollar amount in the onHoldAmount field is a charge (debit) to the seller or a credit. Typically, the enumeration value returned here will be CREDIT, since on-hold funds should eventually be released as part of a payout to the seller once the hold is cleared.

**shippingLabelBookingEntry** | **string** | The enumeration value indicates whether the dollar amount in the shippingLabelAmount field is a charge (debit) to the seller or a credit. Typically, the enumeration value returned here will be DEBIT, as eBay will charge the seller when eBay shipping labels are purchased, but it can be CREDIT if the seller was refunded for a shipping label or was possibly overcharged for a shipping label.
